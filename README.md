# Bookstore-Template
A bookstore template made with Bootstrap, using JS and jQuery to manage all operations, like loading JSON files and AJAX to navigate between pages. No backend is setup yet.
This was a project for University, and browser compatibility or responsiveness was not considered. So, this may not work on older browsers and will not look good on mobile devices.
